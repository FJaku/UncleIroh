# UncleIroh
Simple JS inject script that displays an Uncle Iroh quote whenever you google search for a front-end related problem. Relax.

"It is usually best to admit mistakes when they occur, and to seek to restore honor.",

Thanks to usr Prezadito for the list of quotes.


Planned features:
Add support for back-end devs.
